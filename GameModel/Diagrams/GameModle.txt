PROJECT STRUCTURE AND ROLES
==================================================

1. GameModel.Characters
--------------------------------------------------
Character (abstract)
Role:
  Represents any playable or non-playable fighter in the game.
  Defines universal attributes (Health, MaxHealth, Armor, AttackPower) and universal actions (TakeDamage, Heal, EquipItem, GetFinalStats).
Interactions:
  - Receives Items that boost stats via EquipItem.
  - Stores Abilities (like Fireball or PowerStrike).
  - Is passed into CombatSystem methods (Attack, Heal, UseAbility) to perform actions.
  - Note: Does NOT handle logging directly; pure data model.

Warrior
Role:
  A strength-based class with higher melee attack and physical durability.
Interactions:
  - Inherits from Character.
  - Benefits effectively from weapons (Sword) and armor (Shield).
  - Initializes with the unique "Power Strike" ability.

Mage
Role:
  A magic-based class with powerful abilities but lower armor and health.
Interactions:
  - Inherits from Character.
  - Initializes with the "Fireball" ability.
  - often benefits from magic items (MagicAmulet).

2. GameModel.Items
--------------------------------------------------
Item (abstract)
Role:
  A general blueprint for all equippable items that modify character stats or grant abilities.
Interactions:
  - Added to a character via Character.EquipItem().
  - Can grant Abilities (e.g., MagicAmulet grants Fireball).
  - Used indirectly by CombatSystem when calculating final Attack/Armor/Health values.

Sword
Role:
  An offensive item that increases physical attack.
Interactions:
  - Increases the character’s AttackPower.

Shield
Role:
  A defensive item that increases armor.
Interactions:
  - Reduces damage taken by improving total Armor.

MagicAmulet
Role:
  A magical item that boosts non-physical traits or grants spell-like abilities.
Interactions:
  - Grants a bonus ability (Fireball) and extra Health.

3. GameModel.Abilities
--------------------------------------------------
Ability (abstract)
Role:
  Defines any special action a character can perform beyond a normal attack.
Interactions:
  - Triggered inside CombatSystem.UseAbility().
  - Applies its effects to the target character (damage, healing, etc.) via the Apply() method.

Fireball
Role:
  A magical damage-dealing ability.
Interactions:
  - Used by Mages or provided by items like the MagicAmulet.
  - Deals fixed damage (75) regardless of armor.

PowerStrike
Role:
  A heavy melee attack that deals extra physical damage.
Interactions:
  - Exclusive to the Warrior class by default.
  - Deals double the character's total attack damage.

4. GameModel.Logging
--------------------------------------------------
ICombatLogger (interface)
Role:
  Defines how combat-related actions (attacks, abilities, healing) should be logged.
Interactions:
  - Used by CombatSystem to record actions.
  - Decouples the output method (Console, File, etc.) from game logic.

ConsoleLogger
Role:
  Writes combat events specifically to the system console.
Interactions:
  - Implements ICombatLogger.
  - Injected into CombatSystem at runtime.

5. GameModel.Combat
--------------------------------------------------
CombatSystem
Role:
  The core engine that drives battles. Handles attacking, healing, applying abilities, and logging every action.
Interactions:
  - Holds a reference to ICombatLogger to record events.
  - Performs calculations using a character’s base stats + item bonuses.
  - Executes abilities via Ability.Apply().
  - Coordinates the flow of battle between attacker and defender.
